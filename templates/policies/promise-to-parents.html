  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>At RDAB the safety and wellbeing of children and young people is our highest priority. This “Promise to Parents” sets out how we protect children in our community, both online and during in-person meetups. We are a community fan project run by volunteers, and while we take safeguarding seriously, we are not a statutory body. Parents and guardians remain ultimately responsible for their child’s safety and conduct.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Safe Online</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Children under 13 require parental consent to use the RDAB App.</li>
    <li>We only collect the minimum information needed to operate accounts (trainer username, PIN, memorable password, avatar, event progress).</li>
    <li>No private messaging with strangers or unsafe features are permitted in the app.</li>
    <li>Admins monitor app activity and moderate community spaces, but only the RDAB App is suitable for under-13s.</li>
    <li>Children are not permitted to use RDAB’s external community channels (Campfire, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, X). If a child under 13 is found using these platforms, temporary suspension or blocking may be applied.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Safe at Events</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All official RDAB events listed as “hosted by a Community Ambassador” in Niantic Campfire are supervised by trained admins and volunteers.</li>
    <li>At least one admin at every event will hold an up-to-date DBS check and safeguarding training through Get Doncaster Moving.</li>
    <li>Young people under 16 must be accompanied by a parent, guardian, or trusted adult at all times. Failure to comply may result in the child being asked to leave.</li>
    <li>All attendees are responsible for their own safety and wellbeing. For children, this rests with the accompanying adult.</li>
    <li>Ambassadors and volunteers check that meeting points and play areas are as safe as possible. Risk assessments are proportionate and informal; copies are available on request.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Respect and Care</h2>
  <p>We have a zero tolerance policy for bullying, harassment, discrimination, or abusive behaviour. All members are expected to act with kindness, respect, and fairness.</p>
  <p>If a child or young person is found engaging in harmful behaviour, RDAB will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notify their parent, guardian, or trusted adult.</li>
    <li>Record the incident in the RDAB administration log.</li>
    <li>Give time to reflect, calm down, and understand their actions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Repeated incidents may lead to formal warnings or a ban from attending community events.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Reporting Concerns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For immediate safety concerns call 999.</li>
    <li>For non-emergency safeguarding concerns contact the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000 or your local authority safeguarding team.</li>
    <li>RDAB does not investigate safeguarding concerns, but if an incident occurs during one of our events or on a platform we use, notify us immediately so we can log and take appropriate action.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Review of Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if safeguarding legislation changes, a safeguarding incident highlights the need for change, or RDAB expands into new platforms or services.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Closing Statement</h2>
  <p>Together with parents and guardians, RDAB is committed to ensuring that our app, events, and community remain safe, positive, and welcoming. Safeguarding is a shared responsibility, and by working together we can ensure that young people are protected while enjoying everything our community offers.</p>
