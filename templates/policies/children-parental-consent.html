  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>RDAB welcomes young trainers but takes their safety and privacy extremely seriously. This policy explains how children’s accounts are managed in the RDAB App, what data is collected, how parental consent is handled, and the rights of parents or guardians. RDAB is a volunteer-run, non-profit fan project. We do not sell, trade, or monetise children’s data.</p>

  <h2>2. Children Under 13</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Children under 13 must have parental or guardian consent to hold an RDAB App account.</li>
    <li>We collect only the minimum information required: trainer username, PIN, and parent or guardian contact details.</li>
    <li>Children cannot directly check in with Campfire or other Niantic services.</li>
    <li>Event attendance for children is managed manually by RDAB admins using QR systems or other safe methods.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Parental Rights</h2>
  <p>Parents and guardians have full control over their child’s account and data. They may request copies of data, request corrections, request deletion, or revoke consent at any time. Withdrawing consent results in immediate account closure and data deletion. RDAB will act on parental requests as quickly as possible.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. How to Give Consent</h2>
  <p>During sign-up a parent or guardian must approve a child’s account. This confirms that they understand what data is collected, how it will be used, and their right to withdraw consent at any time. By giving consent, the parent or guardian agrees that their child may use the RDAB App in line with this policy and our Safeguarding Policy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Restrictions on Children’s Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Children under 13 may only use the RDAB App, which is designed to be safe for younger users.</li>
    <li>Children are not permitted on RDAB’s official community channels hosted on platforms such as Campfire, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or X.</li>
    <li>If an underage child is found using these external platforms, RDAB will block or suspend access until they reach the permitted age.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Children’s data is stored securely using Google Cloud and related services. Only RDAB admins have access to this data, and only for the purpose of managing accounts and attendance. Information storage is limited to reduce risk and exposure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Review of Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if safeguarding or data protection laws change, or if a consent issue highlights the need for updates.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Closing Statement</h2>
  <p>Children are welcome in RDAB, but their safety and privacy are paramount. By working together with parents and guardians we ensure that children enjoy the Pokémon GO community in a safe, responsible, and transparent way.</p>
