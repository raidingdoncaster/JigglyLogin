</section>

    <li>RDAB admins will review appeals fairly and respond within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
    <li>Decisions are final, but you will be informed clearly of the outcome.</li>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
  <p>The User Appeals Process ensures fairness and transparency when a member’s account is restricted, suspended, or permanently terminated for breaching RDAB policies (including the Terms of Service, Safeguarding Policy, and Community Standards).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. How to Submit an Appeal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Appeals must be submitted in writing by email to <a href="mailto:raidingdoncaster@gmail.com">raidingdoncaster@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    <li>Include your trainer username and account details, the date of the ban or suspension, and a clear explanation of why the action should be reconsidered.</li>
    <li>For users under 18, a parent or guardian must submit the appeal on the child’s behalf.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Review Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Appeals are reviewed by at least two RDAB admins who were not directly involved in the original action wherever possible.</li>
    <li>The review considers the reason for the ban or suspension, any evidence or logs recorded by admins, the user’s previous behaviour, and the explanation provided.</li>
    <li>Admins aim to respond within 14 days of receiving an appeal.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Possible Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Uphold</strong> – the ban or suspension remains in place.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce</strong> – the restriction is shortened or changed (for example temporary instead of permanent).</li>
    <li><strong>Overturn</strong> – the account is reinstated in full.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All outcomes are communicated clearly to the user or their parent or guardian.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Final Decisions</h2>
  <p>The outcome of an appeal is final. There is no second stage of escalation. RDAB reserves the right to refuse further appeals where the same issue has already been reviewed.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Abuse of the Appeals Process</h2>
  <p>Submitting multiple appeals without new information, using false identities, or harassing admins during the process may result in further restrictions or a permanent ban.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Closing Statement</h2>
  <p>RDAB is committed to fairness, transparency, and consistency in moderation. This appeals process ensures members have the opportunity to be heard while protecting the community from ongoing harm. By participating in RDAB you agree to respect the outcome of this process.</p>
