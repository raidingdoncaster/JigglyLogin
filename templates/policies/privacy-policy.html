  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – when you create an account (or when a parent provides consent for a child under 13).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong> – to keep the app safe, secure, and working properly.</li>

  <p><strong>Data retention:</strong> we keep your data only as long as needed to operate the app and community. If you leave, you can request deletion of your account and data.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>Data is stored using trusted services such as Google Cloud, Google Sheets, and secure databases. Measures are in place to prevent unauthorised access, alteration, or misuse. As a community-run project we cannot guarantee absolute security, so parents and guardians should monitor children’s use of the app.</p>

    <li>Children under 13 may only use the app with parental consent.</li>
