  <p><strong>Policy:</strong> Safeguarding Policy – RDAB App &amp; Community<br>
  <strong>Organisation:</strong> Raiding Doncaster and Beyond (RDAB)<br>
  <strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01/10/2026</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
  <p>RDAB is committed to creating a safe, positive, and welcoming environment for all children, young people, and vulnerable adults across the RDAB App, official platforms, and in-person events. We are a volunteer-led fan community. While we have clear safeguarding rules, we are not a statutory safeguarding body. Parents, guardians, or trusted adults remain responsible for the safety, supervision, and wellbeing of any child who participates in RDAB activities. We have a zero-tolerance approach to abuse, bullying, discrimination, exploitation, and neglect. Safeguarding is a shared responsibility.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Who This Policy Applies To</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to all RDAB admins, moderators, volunteers, community members, and third parties working with us. It covers use of the RDAB App and connected platforms, attendance at community events and meetups, and online interactions through RDAB channels.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Principles of Safeguarding</h2>
  <p>We follow the guiding principles of UK safeguarding (Children Act 1989 and 2004; Working Together to Safeguard Children 2018):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The welfare of the child is paramount.</li>
    <li>Every child has the right to protection, regardless of age, ability, gender, race, religion, or identity.</li>
    <li>All suspicions or concerns should be taken seriously.</li>
    <li>Safeguarding is a shared duty.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Safeguarding Online (RDAB App and Digital Platforms)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Children under 13 may only hold RDAB App accounts with parental consent.</li>
    <li>Data collected is limited to what is necessary (trainer username, PIN, avatar, event progress).</li>
    <li>Children cannot check in directly via Campfire; attendance is managed by admins.</li>
    <li>No unsafe private messaging is permitted within the RDAB App.</li>
    <li>Admins monitor official RDAB channels, but only the app is suitable for children under 13.</li>
    <li>Children are not permitted on RDAB’s external community channels until they reach 13. If underage use is identified, RDAB may suspend access or block accounts until the child reaches the permitted age.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Safeguarding at Events</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All official RDAB events listed as “hosted by a Community Ambassador” in Niantic Campfire are supervised by trusted admins and volunteers.</li>
    <li>At least one admin at each event will normally hold a DBS check and safeguarding awareness training.</li>
    <li>Young people under 16 must attend events with a parent, guardian, or trusted adult at all times; unaccompanied children may be asked to leave.</li>
    <li>Responsibility and liability for children rests with their parent, guardian, or trusted adult.</li>
    <li>Event areas are checked for safety where possible. Risk assessments are proportionate to our community-run model and are available on request.</li>
    <li>Any incidents or concerns at events are logged by admins.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Code of Conduct</h2>
  <p>Community members must treat others with respect, avoid abuse or discrimination, and report concerns immediately. Admins and volunteers must put the welfare of young people first, maintain appropriate boundaries, avoid one-to-one private contact with under-18s, use official RDAB channels, and record safeguarding incidents clearly.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Reporting Concerns</h2>
  <p>If you are worried about a child or young person’s welfare:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For immediate danger call 999.</li>
    <li>For non-urgent concerns contact the NSPCC helpline (0808 800 5000) or your local authority safeguarding team.</li>
    <li>If an incident occurs during an RDAB event or on an RDAB platform, notify an admin so it can be logged and appropriate steps taken.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>RDAB will treat concerns seriously, take proportionate action, and work with parents or guardians to address behaviour issues.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Training and Awareness</h2>
  <p>Admins and volunteers receive basic safeguarding awareness training, discuss responsibilities regularly, and ensure this policy is communicated clearly to parents, guardians, and community members.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>9. Review of Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if legislation changes, an incident highlights the need for revision, or RDAB expands into new services or platforms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>10. Closing Statement</h2>
  <p>By joining RDAB events, activities, or using the RDAB App, all members agree to uphold this Safeguarding Policy. With parents, guardians, volunteers, and community members working together, RDAB remains a safe, welcoming, and positive space for every trainer.</p>
